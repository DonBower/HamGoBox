# Adafruit Python ADS1x15
Python code to use the ADS1015 and ADS1115 analog to digital converters with a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone black.

## Installation

To install the library from source (recommended) run the following commands on a Raspberry Pi or other Debian-based OS system:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev
    cd ~/Developer/github/adafruit
    git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15.git
    cd Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15
    sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively you can install from pip with:

    sudo pip install adafruit-ads1x15

Note that the pip install method **won't** install the example code.
